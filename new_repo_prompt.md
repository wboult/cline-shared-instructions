# New Repository Setup for Cline

This is a new repository. Please help me set it up properly with Cline shared instructions:

## First Steps

1. Check if the shared instructions repository is available:
   - Path should be at: `/c/Dev/shared_cline_instructions`
   - If not accessible, clone from: `https://github.com/wboult/cline-shared-instructions.git`

2. Create and set up essential files:
   - Create a `buffer.md` file in the root directory with this structure:
     ```markdown
     # Buffer File
     
     [General notes and content can go here]
     
     ## INSTRUCTIONS BUFFER
     [New instructions will be placed here and should be checked regularly]
     ```
   - Set up a `docs/` directory with a `project_context.md` file for knowledge management

3. Establish project-specific instructions:
   - Create custom instructions file based on appropriate template from shared instructions
   - Include references to shared base instructions and knowledge management directives
   - Add project-specific development guidelines, testing requirements, etc.

## Knowledge Management Setup

1. Initialize the knowledge store at `docs/project_context.md` with:
   - Project Overview section
   - System Architecture section (or placeholder)
   - Component Documentation section (or placeholder)
   - Known Issues section (empty initially)
   - Roadmap section for planned features
   - Changelog section starting with initial setup

## Real-time Collaboration

Remember to check the `buffer.md` file at regular intervals for any new instructions or feedback I might add while you're working.

## Check for Updates

Before starting any task, ensure the shared instructions are up-to-date by running:
```
git -C /c/Dev/shared_cline_instructions pull
```

## Project Analysis

Please analyze this repository's structure and files to understand:
1. The technology stack and dependencies
2. The overall architecture and organization
3. Any existing patterns or conventions to follow

After analysis, provide your understanding of the project and recommend next steps for development or organization.
